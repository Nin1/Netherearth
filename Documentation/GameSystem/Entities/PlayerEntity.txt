PlayerEntity is derived from the WorldEntity class, and includes extra data and behaviour specific to player characters.

#####################
EYE-BASED INTERACTION
#####################

The player has two independent directions associated with them:

Body direction - The direction that the player's body is facing. This is always the direction in the center of the screen.
Eye direction - The direction that the player's eyes are looking. This follows the mouse cursor on the screen.

The Eye direction is used for all interactions, as though the mouse cursor is the player's eyes, and they interact with whatever they are looking at.

#############
INTERACTIONS
#############

The player can perform actions on other entities in the world. These are usually controlled by a human using a mouse. The function "InteractWithWorld" will use cause the player to perform the primary or secondary action of whatever is being looked at on that entity, depending on the input button used.

The PlayerEntity class is kept separate from any user input behaviour, in case multiplayer is supported in the future. For more information on player input, see GameSystem/UI/Input/WorldInput.

##################
PICKING UP ENTITIES
##################

The player can pick up other entities and carry them on the mouse cursor. When an item is held this way, it is actually kept in a hidden InventorySlot in the player's inventory.

##################
INVENTORY
##################

For more information on InventorySlots, see GameSystem/Entity/InventorySlot

The PlayerEntity has a PlayerInventory, which contains a number of InventorySlots, each associated with a "PlayerInventorySlot":

HELD_ITEM - This is the slot used for entities that the player has picked up and is on their cursor
BAG_SLOT_1 - One of the player's bag slots, which can hold any entity as well as a bag at full capacity.
BAG_SLOT_2
BAG_SLOT_3
BAG_SLOT_4
HEAD, BODY, LEGS, FEET, HANDS, WRISTS, BACK, NECK, LRING, RRING - Equipment slots that can only hold appropriate entities
MAIN_HAND, OFF_HAND - Equipment slots that can hold most entities, but are also used for weapons/shields
