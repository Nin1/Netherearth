A MapTile is a single 1x1 tile of the whole map grid. A tile is 4 units * 4 units in the x and z directions, and can generally be 16 units tall (this depends on the ceiling height of the map).

Tiles are structured similarly to Ultima Underworld's tiles, with a few differences.

MESHES

MapTileData can generate a series of meshes from its properties - One for each wall and the floor. These can be generated using the GenerateMesh() function, which requires data from the surrounding map tiles.
